            <h3>cosmetic Dentistry</h3>
            <p>Do you often wish you  had a more attractive and visually pleasing smile so that it could uplift your overall appearance? Many individuals feel the same due to oral concerns such as discolored teeth, damaged teeth, decay, malocclusion, gum diseases, etc.</p>

            <h3>Crowns & Bridges</h3>
            <p>Crowns & Bridges are customized tooth prosthetics used for tooth replacement. Crowns are commonly used to "cap" a damaged tooth or cover an implant to give additional strength for improving its alignment. And bridges are used to cover the space in cases where the patient is missing one or more teeth.</p>

            <h3>Dental Fillings</h3>
            <p>Cavities are one of the most prominent oral concerns, especially among children. They are the direct results of the erosion and decay of the enamel by the microbes that get deposited on the teeth in the form of tartar. </p>
